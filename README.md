# Offline voice interface to control Revox M51 with RaspberryPi and MATRIX Voice
## Highlevel description
The goal is to build a voice interface for the Revox M51 home cinema amplifier. You should be able to say something like: "WAKEWORD, start TV" to start the TV.

###Why nod ALEXA or Google HOME?
These devices have no "skills" for the Revox device yet. Another issue is, that these devices need an internet connection and the goal of this project is to build a complete offline voice interface with a small set of specific commands and specific/ individual control-phrases.

## Needed Hardware
1. Revox M51: https://www.revox.com/de/audiosysteme/m-systeme/module-m51m10.html
2. Revox Re:connect M202 ethernet interface with Ethernet cable and RJ11 cable
3. Raspberryi Pi 3
4. MATRIX Voice hardware: https://www.matrix.one/products/voice

## Installation guide (TBD)
1. download `install.sh`
2. make `install.sh` executable: `sudo chmod +x install.sh`
3. run the script `./install.sh`
